# Overview

This is an app developed to help me practice both app design and gain a better understanding of the Kotlin language

This is an app designed and targeted towards pregnant women. It is intended to help women keep track of their pregnancy and how many weeks pregnant they are by taking their due date and using it to calculate how far along they are. With this information the app also displays a developmental fact about their baby and the size of their baby compared to fruit based on how many weeks pregnant they are.

# Development Environment

The environment I used to develop this app is Android Studio Code with a Android API 32 Google Play Emulator

The programming language used is Kotlin.  It is run using the java.time.LocalDate library to be able to use dates and the java.time.temporal.ChronoUnit library which allows the program to run a function to find the number of days between two dates.

# Future Work

* Be able to have real user input of the date
* Add more features to the app such as, a way to keep track of weight and doctors’ appointments
* Add a way to save the woman’s due date in the app so it continues to keep track of their pregnancy week by week without having to re-enter their due date every time they open the app.
